<h2>Algorithm and Function List</h2>

This package implements steps 3 through 8 of Horne's algorithm.  The
user is responsible for steps 1 and 2. The steps and implementation
follow.

<li>Step 1: Initial image processing - The user is responsible.  This
would include any sky subtraction or preprocessing. The package also
requires the user to estimate the start and end x coordinate of the
star's profile.

<li>Step 2: Initial variance estimates - The user is responsible.
Horne suggests (Reduced data)/Gain + (RMS read noise)^2.  To further
estimate the variance the package needs to know the readnoise and gain
of the array.  Also any preprocessing steps that add or reduce noise
in the data need to be included in skyvar, which will be added to
every varaince estimation.

<li>Step 3: Fit sky background - fitbg.pro.  Before an accurate
profile can be estimated any remaining background bias must be
subtracted off. This function fits the background outside the
horizontal extraction boundaries at each wavelength in the data.  It
runs procvect.pro on each wavelength using the initial variance
estimates as weights. It creates its own mask of bad pixels, using the
user input mask as a start.

<li>Step 4: Extract standard spectrum - stdspec.pro.  Sums each
background-subtracted wavelength within the bounds.

<li>Step 5: Construct spatial profile.

<li>Step 6: Revise variance estimates - fitprof.pro.  Initially
creates the spatial profile by (reduced - background) / (standard
spectrum) Then uses procvect.pro on each column (which uses a sigma
rejection scheme) with variance / spectrum^2 as weights.  The user can
select to fit a polynomial to each column, a running average to each
colum, or a Gaussian to each row.  The polynomial fit is default and
the degree of fit can be user-defined.  A degree of 3 is default.  The
running average fit actually uses a median filter when identifying bad
pixels, then calculates a running average to return a profile.  The
Gaussian fit is a single dimension Gaussian, so any background
geometry not identified by the background fitting will be
problematic. All values are then made positive, and each wavelength is
normalized to 1.  

<li>Step 7: Mask cosmic ray hits.  - Done at every stage 

<li>Step 8: Extract optimal spectrum. - extrspec.pro After a profile
and background (assumed to be perfect) are found extraction can occur.
For each wavelength the spectrum is extracted and bad pixels are
rejected using procvect, iterating until no bad pixels are found.  The
optimal extraction achieves the highest possible signal to noise ratio
by weighting the pixels proportional to the profile divided by the
variance.  

<li>Step 9: Iteration - The iteration scheme we used is suggested by
Horne.  Iterate 3 by itself to find cosmic rays in the background
section. Iterate 5 and 6 to find the spatial profile image, but do not
use the bad pixel mask found in step 5 for the extraction. Rather,
next iterate 6, 7, and 8 to mask cosmic rays and optimally extract the
spectrum.

</pre>
<li>Optspecextr.pro: Main driver routine. Gets the background frame
from fitbg, the standard spectrum from stdextr, the profile frame
from fitprof and the optimal spectrum from extrspec.
<p>
<li>Fitbg.pro: Sends the data at each wavelength (row) to
procvect.pro, using a polynomial fit and ignoring the data within the
object limits. The resulting background fit is evaluated and
subtracted from the input data.
<p>
<li>Fitprof.pro: Driver for spatial profile fitting.  The user may
choose either a polynomial fit or a boxcar average along the spectral
direction or a Gaussian fit along the spatial direction. The routine
sets up the calculation and calls procvect.pro on each vector in the
data, building a 2D frame with the results.  If the spectrum trace is
curved more by more than 2 pixels or if it changes quickly, the data
can be expanded and shifted prior to profile estimation by a user set
function. Adjgauss.pro is included in the package for this purpose.
<p>
<li>Stdextr.pro: Calculates standard extraction, totaling each row
within the spectrum bounds.
<p>
<li>Extrspec.pro: Runs procvect.pro on each row of constant
wavelength, which optimally estimates the spectrum amplitude at that
point and calculates the variance.
<p>
<li>Summaryopt.pro: Sends summary information to the screen for the
user.
<p>
<li>Procvect.pro: Iteratively fits a function to a linear array,
removing up to one extreme pixel per iteration until none are found.
It begins by either fitting the non-masked data or optimally
extracting the spectrum and subtracting the result from the input
data.  The pixel with the largest residual (if it exceeds THRESH) is
masked (marked as bad), and variances are recalculated.  The process
repeats with the original data and the new mask until no bad pixels
are found.  Finally, either the fit is evaluated at all values and
returned or a final extraction is returned.
<p>
Functions ending in "func" may be given to procvect as an argument.
<p>
<li>Polyfunc.pro: Fits a polynomial of specified degree to the data
vector divided by spectrum weighted inversely to the variance.
<p>
<li>Gaussfunc.pro: Fits a Gaussian to the data / spectrum weighted
inversely to the variance.  If a Gaussian does not accuratly describe
the data (because of a ray), if will try to fit it to median
filtered data.
<p>
<li>Extractfunc.pro: Optimally extracts the spectrum at that row.
<p>
<li>Boxcarfunc.pro: Returns data / spectrum with a  median filter when
searching for cosmic rays, then returns a running average to the data
when all the bad pixels have been eliminated.
<p>
<li>Centermass.pro: Returns the center of mass for the data vector
over the spectrum vector.
<p>
<li>Adjguass.pro: Given a stack of data frames and the optimal
extraction info, shifts and expands the input frames so that the
centers of the profile (and optionally widths) of the profile line up.
<p>
<li>Findshift.pro: Finds the center of the profile for each row in the
data frame.
<p>
<li>Sampleshift.pro: Given a data frame and a coresponding in
coordiante array, returns a data frame corespoding to the out
coordinate array, formed from the in data frame.
<p>
<li>In.pro: Trivial function to test if an element is in an array
<p>
<li>Keyword_defined.pro: Trivial function to see in a variable is defined.
<p>
<li>Polyeval.pro: Evaluates polynomial coefficents
<p>
<li>Testoptextr.pro: Tests the installation of the package.  
(Useful as example.)
