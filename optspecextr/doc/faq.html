<h2>Frequently-Asked Questions</h2>

Q: Why is everything in double precision when the input data is most
likely single precision?
<p>
A: The short answer is it prevents a systematic bias in the final
output.  The cause of this bias was traced to an error in floating
point representation of the profile image.  When a perfect (no noise,
straight trace, no bad pixels, ...) image was tested, there was
symetric error at machine level precision in the profile image created
by looping procvect.pro.  However, as this image was scaled to make
sure each wavelength summed to 1, the error became off-center.  This
error was componded in later steps and eventually showed up in the
final spectrum.  There was no way to scale a floating point array
without this occuring, so instead everything is done in double
precision.

Q: Help! The program keeps masking all of my data points. What's wrong?
<p>
A: The probable answer lies in the variance image creation.  The
routine uses and iterative sigma-cliping calculation using: Residual =
(Data - Background - Spectrum*Profile)^2 / Variance If the variance
estimate is wrong, the procvect routine can end up clipping way too
many or too few pixels easily.  The background fiting and the first
pass of the profile fitting use the inital variance estimates that are
passed in.  However, each subsequent pass in profile fitting, and in
the optimal extraction iteration, the variance image used is
recalculated based on: Variance = Readnoise^2 + Abs(Spectrum*Profile +
Background) / EPADU Therefore, if your estimates for read noise or
gain are off, each revisted estimate will be inaccurate.  The
sigma-clipping routine is sensitve to both rdnoise and gain. If
background pixels are wrongly masked, the readnoise is proabably off.
If the high-intensity pixels are masked, then it is probably the gain.
<p>
Another problem could stem from inaccurate estimation of the fit.  If
the profile image is changing more rapidly than can be modeled by a
third degree polynomial, the degree must be increased, or a different
fit used.  Similarly, if skylines are curved too much (more than three
pixels spell distator for polynomial fitting) the background fitting
routine won't be able to model the background.
