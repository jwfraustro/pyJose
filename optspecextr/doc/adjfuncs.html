<h2>Trace Straightening Tricks</h2>

<p>
The package allows the user to adjust the data image as he or she
needs prior to profile fitting.  For example, if the profile's trace
is curved or changes quickly between rows, some sort of staightening
may be used.
<p>
The polynomial and median fitting functions assume that the profile is
slowly varying in terms of wavelength. If this is not the case a large
number of pixels can be erroneously masked off during the profile
fitting and optimal extraction.
<p>
The basic optimal spectrum extraction functions are designed to work
without knowledge of what the adjustment functions do to the data.
The package calls the function passed in through ADJFUNC with the data
frames it needs.  For convince, any options to the adjustment function
are passed through ADJOPTIONS, which if more than one option is
needed, can be a structure.  Likewise, ADJPARMS, which contains the
parameters of the data array can also be a structure.  For simplicity,
since not all adjustment functions need all of the information optimal
extraction uses, that info is also passed through a structure.
<p>
Included in the optimal extraction package is ADJGAUSS, which uses
Gaussian fitting to line up the centers and widths of the profile.  To
use this technique on the data, call optspecextr with the ADJFUNC
parmater equal to ADJGAUSS.  The options to adjgauss are held in the
keyword ADJOPTIONS, which takes a structure.  Some cases to use
adjgauss include:

<h3>Correcting for Changing Profile Center or Width</h3>

<b>Quickly varying center:</b> If the center of the profile changes
quickly with wavelength, it might be possible to line up the centers
using adjgauss.pro.  First set the ADJFUNC keyword to adjguass. Then
pass in a structure with the tag CENTER = 1 to the ADJOPTIONS
keyword:<br>
<pre>
	IDL> OptSpec = Optspecextr(Data, varim, rn, Q, x1, x2, adjfunc=adjgauss, $
		adjoptions = {center:1})<br>
</pre>
<b>Quickly varying width:</b>  If the width of the profile changes
quickly with wavelength then set the tag WIDTH = 1 in the ADJOPTIONS
keyword.<br>
<pre>
	IDL> OptSpec = Optspecextr(Data, varim, rn, Q, x1, x2, adjfunc=adjgauss, $
		adjoptions = {width:1})<br>
</pre>
<b>Slowly varying center:</b> If the center does move between the top
and bottom of the CCD, it might be best to fit a polynomial to the
centers and used that as the estimate of shift.  Set CENTERFIT = 1 in
the ADJOPTIONS keyword to perform a polynomial fit to each row's shift
amount. Set CENTERDEG to the appropriate polynomial fitting degree
(usually 2-4) and CENTER tag to 1 
<pre>
	IDL> OptSpec = Optspecextr(Data, varim, rn, Q, x1, x2, adjfunc=adjgauss, $
		adjoptions = {center:1, centerfit:1, centerdeg:2})<br>
</pre>

<h3>Writing Your Own Adjustment Function</h3>
If your data requires a different adjustment to the data before fitting
the profile you can write your own function.  The specs of your driver
function:<br> 
<center>OutArray = ADJFUNC(InArray, OptInfo, AdjParms=AdjParms,
AdjOptions=AdjOptions, Revert=Revert)</center> 
OutArray: A data cube where each slice is a modifed image <br> 
InArray: A data cube where each slice is an image to be modified.<br>
OptInfo: A structure with all the Optimal Extraction Package's information on
the data array up to the begining of profile fitting<br> 
AdjParms: A varaible where internal data can be saved in order to be used when
it is necessary to convert the fitted array back into the origional shape.<br>
AdjOptions: A variable where options needed for your function can be passed
through.<br> 
Revert: If set, InArray contains modified images and the function should
revert them to the origional size and shape.<br> 
<p>
To use your function set the ADJFUNC keyword to the name of your function
and the ADJOPTIONS keyword to any options your function accepts.  Prior to
profile fitting and after background fitting the optimal extraction package
with create a data cube by stacking the data image, variance image, background
image, and sky variance image. It will pass this data through InArray.  It
then expects to find in OutArray a stack of the data image, varaince image,
background image, and sky variance image in the same order passed in.  The
user defined function does not need to worry about what is in the arrays, only
that they are stacked through the Z dimension.  
<p>
Any information about the data array is saved in OptInfo:<br>
.Dataim: The data image<br>
.Varim: The variance image<br>
.Bgim: The fitted background image<br>
.Skyvar: The sky variance image<br>
.Q: The gain of the array<br>
.V0: The readnoise of the array<br>
.X1: The start pixel for the profile image<br>
.X2: The end pixel for the profile image<br>
.Spec: The standard extracted spectrum<br>
