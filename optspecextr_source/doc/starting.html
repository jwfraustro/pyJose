<h3>Preparing Data</h3>

The most straightforward use of the package requires six inputs: a
data image, an initial variance estimate, the gain and read noise of
the array, and pixel locations bounding the spectrum in the spatial
direction. The data image is the object frame from which you wish to
extract the spectrum. The spectrum must run in the vertical direction,
and lines of constant wavelength are assumed to be parallel to the
horizontal direction.  The initial variance estimate is an array of
the same size as the data image, but containing each pixel's variance
estimate.  Horne suggests
<p>
		variance = abs(Data) / Gain + ReadNoise ^ 2
<p>
as a good estimate, where gain is in units of electrons per data
number (EPADU) and ReadNoise is in units of electrons.  The spatial
bounds are pixel locations in the horizontal direction. Only data
between the bounds contribute to the final spectrum.  All pixels in
the vertical direction contribute to the spectrum.  The bounds should
be set widely because the algorithm minimizes the influence of noisy
pixels far from the peak of the profile.
<p>
If part of your preprocessing is sky subtraction (e.g., in the
infrared), set skyvarim and rnsky to the sky variance image and sky
read noise, respectively.  These values will be added to the variance
image as it is refined to reflect the increase in noise attributed to
sky subtraction.
<p>
The importance of an accurate variance image can not be overstressed.
The variance image is used to calculate which pixels are off because
of noise, and which are cosmic rays.  It is also used to weight the
pixels for the final optimal extraction.  To accuratly predict the
noise of the data, the skyvarim must include noise estimates for all
pre-processing steps that might introduce noise.  Any noise source
must be included except read noise for the data image and photon noise
from the calculated background and object spectrum.  If the data have
additional noise sources that are not represented, the routine will
mask good pixels.  If it overestimates noise sources, cosmic rays can
slip through, and the final spectrum will be inaccurate.
<p>
Trim out any bad regions where spectrum extraction is impossible, such
high-variance or unilluminated areas.  If that is not possible, then
mask off that area, or make sure the variance image is correspondingly
high.  Otherwise the routine will incorrectly try to fit these data.

<h3>Example/Test Data</h3>

In the optspecextr/images directory there are four example FITS files.
These files provide input for the following three example runs.  Run
each of these tutorials from the optspecextr/images directory.
<p>
<b>1. Frame with flat background and perpendicular trace</b>
<p>

This is the most basic case. First, read the FITS file:
<pre>
	IDL> frame1 = readfits('ex1.fits', header1)
</pre>
Next, locate the read noise and gain levels for the CCD array.
This FITS file contains that information in the header.
<pre>
	IDL> Q =  sxpar(header1, 'EPADU') 
	IDL> rn = sxpar(header1, 'RDNOISE') / Q 
</pre>
Now, we need to select the object spectrum limits.  This can be done
interactively using a plot of the frame.  The trace is perpendicular,
so any row will do.
<pre>
	IDL> plot, frame1[*,0]
	IDL> plot, frame1[200:300,0]
</pre>
It seems the spectrum spans columns 240 to 270.
<pre>
	IDL> x1 = 240
	IDL> x2 = 270
</pre>	
Now we need to prepare the data and variance images.  Since there is
no sky frame, the data image is the object frame.  The inital estimate
for the variance image is easily calculated.
<pre>
	IDL> dataim = frame1
	IDL> varim = abs(frame1) / Q + rn^2
</pre>
With all of the data now prepared, run optspecextr.
<pre>
	IDL> opspec1 = optspecextr(dataim, varim, rn, Q, x1, x2)
	IDL> plot, opspec1
</pre>

<p>
<b>2. Object and Sky Frames</b>
<p>
	
When working with infrared data where a sky frame is to be used for
sky subtraction, that information needs to be passed on to the optimal
extraction procedure.
<p>
The preparation is identical to Example 1.
<pre>
	IDL> objframe2 = readfits('ex2obj.fits', objheader2)
	IDL> skyframe2 = readfits('ex2sky.fits', skyheader2)
	IDL> Q =     sxpar(objheader2, 'EPADU') 
	IDL> rn =    sxpar(objheader2, 'RDNOISE') / Q 
	IDL> rnsky = sxpar(skyheader2, 'RDNOISE') / Q 
	IDL> x1 =    240
	IDL> x2 =    270
</pre>
The data image is object frame - sky frame.  An additional sky
variance image must also be created.  The initial variance estimate
must reflect the additional image processing step.
<pre>
	IDL> dataim = objframe2 - skyframe2
	IDL> skyvar = abs(skyframe2) / Q + rnsky^2
	IDL> varim =  abs(skyframe2 + objframe2) / Q + rnsky^2 + rn^2
</pre>
The call for optspecextr uses the SKYVARIM keyword:
<pre
	IDL> opspec2 = optspecextr(dataim, varim, rn, Q, x1, x2, $
	                           skyvar=skyvar)
	IDL> plot, opspec2
</pre>

<a href="images/ex2sky.jpg"><img src="images/ex2skysmall.jpg"></a>

<p>
<b>3. Frame with Curved Trace</b>
<p>
A frame with a curved trace cannot fit the profile using a polynomial
fit along the wavelength dimension because the trace intercepts some
columns more than once and is poorly fit by a polunomial.  Instead try
either the boxcar filter or Gaussian fit.
<p>
The preparation begins as above:
<pre>
	IDL> frame3 = readfits('ex3.fits', header3)
	IDL> Q =  sxpar(header3, 'EPADU') 
	IDL> rn = sxpar(header3, 'RDNOISE') / Q 
</pre>
However, the curved trace makes setting spectrum limits more
difficult.  Take a look at the frame to get the general idea.
<pre>
	IDL> tv, frame3
</pre>	
The minimum occurs and the top and bottom of the frame, while the
maximum occurs about halfway down the frame.
<pre>
	IDL> plot, frame3[200:300,0]
	IDL> plot, frame3[200:300,255]
	IDL> plot, frame3[200:300,511]
</pre>	
It spans from about 240 to 280.
<pre>
	IDL> x1 = 240
	IDL> x2 = 280
</pre>	
Now run optspecextr with either the FITGAUSS or FITBOXCAR keyword.
<pre>
	IDL> dataim = frame3
	IDL> varim = abs(frame3) / Q + rn^2
	IDL> opspec3gauss = optspecextr(dataim, varim, rn, Q, x1, x2, $
	                                /fitgauss)
	IDL> dataim = frame3
	IDL> varim = abs(frame3) / Q + rn^2
	IDL> opspec3rsa = optspecextr(dataim, varim, rn, Q, x1, x2, $
	                              /fitboxcar)
</pre>

<b>4. Straightening the Trace</b>
<p>
A curved frame may also be corrected using the straightening.
This technique upsamples the data frame by 7 pixels, shifts each row
by an estimated center correction.  Then the usual fitting methods can
be used to fit the expanded data.  Before use the profile is
downsampled.
<p>
The preparation begins just like before.
<pre>
	IDL> frame4 = readfits('ex4.fits', header4)
	IDL> Q =  sxpar(header4, 'EPADU') 
	IDL> rn = sxpar(header4, 'RDNOISE') / Q 
</pre>
In order to show the correction more clearly this frame is only curved
in the x direction.  The shift4.fits file contains the shift amount
<pre>
	IDL> traceact = readfits('shift4.fits')
        IDL> plot, traceact
</pre>
	It seems to span from 235 to 270
<pre>
	IDL> x1 = 235
	IDL> x2 = 270
</pre>
Now run optspecextr with adjfunct keyword equal to adjgauss.  This
will tell the program to send the data frames to adjgauss before
smoothing the profile.  Adjparms.centerest returns the estimated shift
amount.  With the expantion, straightening may take much longer than
other techniques.
<pre>
	IDL> dataim = frame4
	IDL> varim = abs(frame4) / Q + rn^2
        IDL> adjfunc = adjgauss
	IDL> opspec4 = optspecextr(dataim, varim, rn, Q, x1, x2, $
	                           adjfunc=adjfunc, adjparms=adjparms)
        IDL> plot, adjparms.centerest
        IDL> plot, (adjparms.centerest - 4) - traceact
</pre>
